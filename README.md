# Countdown-numbers-game
Python3 script to generate all solutions to a countdown numbers game. 

Countdown is a game show, described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)

The program produces all the solutions to a numbers game, and analyses some statistics relating to the solutions generated

The program eliminates most duplicate entries, but a small number of duplicates slip through when there are strings of additions or multiplications, e.g. a+b+c+d and b+a+c+d might both appear in solutions.
